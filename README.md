# Khosa's Social Hub

This is a one page project designed to collect all of my work and social media presense into one page where people can follow and check out my work.
## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the only web page for the site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using _elements_. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files. Try clicking the image in the center of the page!
