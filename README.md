# Khosa's Social Hub

This is a one page project designed to collect all of my work and social media presense into one page where people can follow and check out my work. All changes are commited to the github repo and automatically built and published and hosted on netlify in a nodejs container. Cloudflare provides free DNS registries and helps keep the website online and fast globally.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, Hello!

← `index.html`: This is the main web page for your site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page.
